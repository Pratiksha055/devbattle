üß≠ 1. Project Overview

DevBattle is a real-time, multiplayer web game where players compete in coding-related quiz battles.

Each player joins a ‚Äúroom,‚Äù answers timed questions, and scores points based on accuracy and speed. The leaderboard updates in real-time using WebSocket connections.

This project aims to demonstrate full-stack development, real-time systems, and agile teamwork ‚Äî integrating backend APIs, socket communication, and a responsive, modern frontend.
